# Ministry Of Vocabulary

A Full Stack app which helps you learn new words, improve your vocabulary and explore mnemonics for associating memory triggers and experiences. 

### Features
1. Node.js/Express.
2. React.js powered by Semantic UI.
3. State Management with Redux.
4. User Authentication with JWT.
5. Database consisting of more than 4000 words with meaning, mnemonics, usage and more.
6. Ability to perform CRUD operations.
7. Secure API calls.

## Future Implementations
1. Pagination in Dashboard component
2. Role/Module Management
3. More Secure API
4. Adding more words, meaning and mneomonics on a daily basis.

## Overview

`create-react-app` configures a Webpack development server to run on `localhost:3000`. This development server will bundle all static assets located under `client/src/`. All requests to `localhost:3000` will serve `client/index.html` which will include Webpack's `bundle.js`.

To prevent any issues with CORS, the user's browser will communicate exclusively with the Webpack development server.

Inside `Client.js`, we use Fetch to make a request to the API:

```js
// Inside Client.js
return fetch(`/api/food?q=${query}`, {
  // ...
})
```

This request is made to `localhost:3000`, the Webpack dev server. Webpack will infer that this request is actually intended for our API server. We specify in `package.json` that we would like Webpack to proxy API requests to `localhost:3001`:

```js
// Inside client/package.json
"proxy": "http://localhost:3001/",
```

This handy features is provided for us by `create-react-app`.

Therefore, the user's browser makes a request to Webpack at `localhost:3000` which then proxies the request to our API server at `localhost:3001`:

This setup provides two advantages:

1. If the user's browser tried to request `localhost:3001` directly, we'd run into issues with CORS.
2. The API URL in development matches that in production. You don't have to do something like this:

```js
// Example API base URL determination in Client.js
const apiBaseUrl = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'localhost:3001' : '/'
```

This setup uses [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) for process management. Executing `npm start` instructs `concurrently` to boot both the Webpack dev server and the API server.

## Deploying

### Background

The app is ready to be deployed to Heroku.

In production, Heroku will use `Procfile` which boots just the server:

```
web: npm run server
```

Inside `server.js`, we tell Node/Express we'd like it to serve static assets in production:

```
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  app.use(express.static('client/build'));
}
```

You just need to have Webpack produce a static bundle of the React app (below).

### Steps

We assume basic knowledge of Heroku.

**0. Setup your Heroku account and Heroku CLI**

For installing the CLI tool, see [this article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line).

**1. Build the React app**

Running `npm run build` creates the static bundle which we can then use any HTTP server to serve:

```
cd client/
npm run build
```

**2. Commit the `client/build` folder to source control**

From the root of the project:

```
git add client/build
git commit -m 'Adding `build` to source control'
```

**3. Create the Heroku app**

```
heroku apps:create <app-name>
```

**4. Push to Heroku**

```
git push heroku master
```

Heroku will give you a link at which to view your live app.
